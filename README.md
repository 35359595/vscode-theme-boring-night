# VSCode Theme Boring Night

A dark theme with very few colors, on the border of boring.

![Preview CoffeeScript](preview/coffee.png)

## Languages supported

The following languages / filetypes are, somewhat, supported:

- Rust :)

If you've tested it with something else - please let me know.

## Issues & Pull Requests

Feel free to open an issue if you experience some strange behaviour.

If possible, include a screenshot and example code in your issue. If you
want to walk the extra mile - fire up the TextMate inspector
**Developer: Inspect TM Scopes** from the _Command Palette_ and
jot down the _"scope"_  in the GitHub issue as well.

If you want to add support for a new language, I will be happy to receive
Pull Requests - but please do not add any colors or make anything _italic_.
